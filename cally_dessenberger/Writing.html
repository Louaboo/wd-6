          Living In A Messed Up World
<br>
Bree, Jay, - 20 ½
<br>
Bree- 19
<br>
Cynthia- 21
<br>
Leon- 20
<br></em>
:( :( :( :(
<br>
<br>"How in Starclan's sake am I going to get out of all of these infected!" Jay hissed as he fought his way through the hordes of infected that were trying to get to him.
<br>
"Duck!" He heard the familiar voice and obeyed, ducking as a brown haired, paralyzed girl in a modified wheelchair bounced off a roof and flew over his head to crash down on a bunch of infected, brutally smashing them.
<br>
"Hi, Jay!" She chirped cheerfully despite the horde they were surrounded by.
<br>
"Tell me you brought Cynthia and Leon as well."
<br>
"I did, here they come!" She grins and spins her chair, knocking a few more down before bouncing up and down as the sound of two silenced pistols being fired echoed nearby. Cynthia emerged, leaping off the roof Bree had been on and firing her silenced pistols as she fell, her handcrafted bow and quiver strapped to her back. "Hi!" Bree grinned throwing a thin throwing small throwing knives in an arch at a multitude of the infected, "I found him!"
<br>
"Awesome, Leon and I found a whole stash of ammo for our pistols, and more tools to add onto your wheelchair," Cynthia said briskly, switching from her pistols to her simple silver bladed knife, tendrils of her midnight black hair hanging down in front of her face near her nose.
<br>
Jay turned his attention to the black haired sharp shooter, cloudy blue eyes focusing on her. Years ago he had been attacked by an infected that managed to claw at his face and left vicious scars across his face along with a cloudy look and foggy blurry vision. "Where's Leon? You aren't carrying the backpack." Usually, Cynthia carried the backpack that they put found materials in due to her higher speed and agility compared to Leon.
<br>
"That's because Leon's being a pain in the butt because I've been sneezing all morning." She told him in exasperation with a small amount of annoyance in her tone, sapphire blue eyes flashing with partial amusement.
<br>
"Well you aren't infected if that's what he's worried about, you probably have a cold from jumping into the iced-over lake to fetch that supply drop yesterday." Jay told her, "Besides, I do have a few more vials of the immunity cure back at the safe house."
<br>
"Don't tell that to Leon," She mused wielding her blade like she was born to fight.
<br>

"Don't tell me what?" Leon asked as he dropped down to the ground from a roof and crushed a few infected as he landed, flicking crimson blood out of his golden blond hair and amber eyes, standing in a fighting stance, his brass knuckles on and streaked with dried and wet blood.
<br>
"That she's pregnant." Jay deadpanned and his brother nearly fell over in shock.
<br>
"What!" Leon yelled staring at his girlfriend who's face flushed bright scarlet, the color so bright it hid the freckles crossing the bridge of her lightly tanned nose and cheekbones.
<br>
"I am not!" She nearly shrieked, her voice high-pitched and strained, "Don't joke about that!" Her blue eyes were wide with shock and horror. To diminish her embarrassment she smacked Jay upside the head and went back to fighting the horde, her ears, visible from her black hair being up in a ponytail, bright scarlet as well, matching the color of her face.
<br>
"What's going on?" Bree asked, rolling back over to them all after having found an escape path during the conversation going on between the three of them.
<br>
"Nothing, just having a conversation involving the new supplies," Jay replied, picking up a chunk of concrete from the broken and dusty cobblestone street before hurling it at an infected; knocking the bloody-clothed infected humanoid creature to the ground with a lovely spot of crimson in place of its previously fat nose.
<br>
"A conversation that nearly gave me a heart attack!" Leon exclaimed, cracking an Infected creature's skull against a dirty brick wall, his ears were a light shade of embarrassed pink.
<br>
"If it gave you a heart attack then my heart stopped." Cynthia retorted in return. "That was a dirty trick Jay-" She cut herself off by sneezing violently.
<br>
"I found an escape path guys!" Bree grinned pointing to a small alleyway, "Let's go!" She shot off into the alley with Jay on her heels, Leon right behind him, Cynthia whipped out her bow, notched a whistling arrow and let it fly into the horde chasing after them, the sound from the arrow causing the humanoid creatures to stumble around and shriek in confusion.
<br>
Jay woke up in the middle of the night to violent coughing. Sitting up and blinking away a small amount of the blurriness of his vision he focused on Leon sitting next to Cynthia who was sitting up and was the source of the coughing, Leon was rubbing her back, blonde eyebrows pinching together in worry. Bree was sitting up as well, looking at the coughing teen with worry in her eyes. "How long has she been coughing?" Jay asked, getting to his feet and crouching next to the other three.
<br>
"She's been coughing on and off all night," Leon told him, "So about three or four hours."
<br>
"That's not good. Look at me Cynthia." Jay asked the coughing girl who gagged before the coughing ceased and she obeyed, lifting her head to look him in the eye, blue eyes groggy with traces of sleep, but had a slight glazed over look. He used the back of his hand to test for a fever and found a very small one. "No more jumping into freezing lakes alright?" He stood up, going over to his stuff and pulling out a medical kit and pulled out a dose from the latest batch of the homemade cold medication he had made a few days ago.
<br>
"What's wrong with her? Is she infected?!" Leon asked, his face pinching with worry.
<br>
"She's just got a small cold from jumping into the icy lake yesterday," Jay replied, crouching back in front of her with a water bottle and the small green pill. "Take this Cynthia, it'll taste disgusting but try and keep it down." Leon took the water bottle and opened it before handing it to the mentioned girl, who took it from him and took the medication, her expression immediately changing to disgust and she literally chugged the water to try and get rid of the taste.
<br>
"Give her some of the immunity Jay," Leon told his brother, "Please,"
<br>
"She already has a lot of it in her system, Leon," Jay cut off his brother as the golden blonde opened his mouth to cut him off. "But," He got to his feet and went over to the medical table where more of the immunity was being produced, "I'll give her a small dose if it'll help ease your mind." He measured out a very small dose of the immunity cure that seemed to cure pretty much everything, the clear pure liquid swirling around in the small clean shot glass and glowing light blue before it settled as he stopped pouring in anymore.
<br>
"Thank you." Leon murmured, hugging his girlfriend who was shivering slightly and had her blue eyes mostly closed.
<br>
"Here, you know the drill Leon, get her to drink it in small sips, I'm going back to bed," Jay muttered, handing his brother the tiny glass before going back to his sleeping area and getting back into the sleeping bag bed each of them had, and closing his eyes. Right away he was dragged into a memory.
<br>
<em>'Ah!" A thirteen-year-old Jay howled, struggling to get the weird humanoid creature off him, he could hear Leon howling in pain near him along with Holly screaming as well.
<br>
"Cynthia!" A higher pitched voice shrieked, "Look! Infected!"
<br>
"Well-" A girl's British sounding voice spoke and got interrupted by the first voice.
<br>
"Don't swear!"
<br>
"Why are you worried about my language at a time like this?!" The British sounding girl was speaking once again.
<br>
"We can't help them." Another female voice spoke, "We'd be killed in the process!"
<br>
"I'm going to act like I didn't hear you." The British voice spoke again and a gunshot rang out, Jay froze in shock and fear, feeling the creature above him go limp and still.
<br>
"Did you just shoot him?!"
<br>
"No you idiot!" the British voice retorted, and Jay felt someone haul the unmoving pile of humanoid creature off of him with a grunt, revealing a girl probably at the most a year older than he was with blood and grime streaking her clothes, a backpack strapped to her back with a small chainsaw strapped to the pack, "I shot the infected creature Haliah, I didn't shoot the boy." She rolled her sapphire blue eyes and went to go help Leon, taking out a rusty pipe from her bag and swinging it against the Infected human's skull, the force of her swing sending him to being fly into a wall where a loud crack was heard, splattering the nearby ground and walls with blood and gore. She dropped the now bloody pipe, before offering a hand to the golden blonde haired boy who took it and she helped him to his feet.
<br>
Once he was on his feet she went over to Holly and grabbed the Infected around the neck before sharply twisting, snapping its neck before pulling it off Holly and moving back to be standing with the other two girls. Jay glanced at Leon who was looking at the British-accented girl with what looked like shock and awe.
<br>
"Who are you?" Leon asked looking slightly dazed, his attention fixed on the blue eyed girl that had saved his life.
<br>
"Well I'm Haliah," A golden blonde girl with bright green eyes, average height, and a few years older than Jay and his siblings spoke "This is Hadara," She gestured to the light blonde with blue eyes who was a little on the tall side and was probably a year older than Haliah. "And this is-"
<br>
"I can introduce myself Haliah." The British-accented girl rolled her eyes before offering a handshake with Leon, "My name's Cynthia." She told them, smiling slightly at the golden blonde in front of her, she was of average height, four inches shorter than Leon, with midnight black hair and sapphire blue eyes.
<br>
Leon shook her hand gently, "My name's Leon, and these are my older siblings, Jay and Holly." He said, amber eyes locked on her blue ones.
<br>
"Leon, we need to get going," Holly fretted going over to her younger brother, "We're going to be killed if we stay here!"
<br>
Jay snorted with amusement as his brother didn't break eye contact with the strange girl as he answered his sister. "I know that Holly."
<br>
"We have a place you guys can stay with us, we came out here hearing screaming." The British-accented girl named Cynthia told the golden blonde in front of her, not breaking eye contact with him either.
<br>
Holly whispered to Jay, "Does Leon have a crush?" She asked with a small amount of amusement and worry. </em>
<br>
:) :) :)
<br>
"Leon, pass me that wrench," Jay told his brother from where they were working together on reinforcing Bree's chair, the girls were sharpening and checking over weapons near them.
<br>
"I don't see one Jay," Leon told him, scratching the back of his head a bit groggily. They had been awake for a few hours, but Leon had been up all night, keeping watch over his sick girlfriend and worried sick about her.
<br>
"Then open your eyes, Leon," Jay grumbled, still holding his hand out for the tool.
<br>
"I got it!" Bree reached over, grabbed the wrench and putting it into Jay's palm, smiling happily, as cheerful as she usually was in the mornings.
<br>
"At least someone's awake and listening." He grouched curtly, using the wrench to tighten the bolts on the new shock absorbers his brother and Cynthia had found
<br>
"Give him some slack Jay," Cynthia soothed the grumpy boy, with amusement in her voice, blue eyes twinkling cheerfully, "he's been up all night." Leon smiled slightly before yawning widely, displaying his tiredness as he paused checking over the spikes made from knife blades
<br>
"I'll cut him some slack when you two can stop preventing each other from getting any sleep in a scattered random pattern of nights." He grunted, tightening the last bolt while the two mentioned didn't even blush, instead, Cynthia continued her actions of cleaning her pistols and Leon argued with his brother.
<br>
"Maybe someone needs to stop being such a pain in the butt and see what's underneath your nose," Leon argued back, hinting at the idea of his brother finally getting together with their companion Bree.
<br>
"Good idea Leon, then maybe he'll stop being a such a big stick in the mud." Cynthia commented, supporting her golden blonde boyfriend and grinning at the black haired boy's maddened huff.
<br>
"I'm not a stick in the mud." He huffed, checking the straps on the wheelchair
<br>
"Jay," She deadpanned, "You are very much a grumpy stick in the mud."
<br>
"You guys! Stop berating him!" Bree interrupted, "He's not a stick in the mud, he's just different than all of us, each of us have a different attitude!" She chirps, supporting Jay and diffusing the argument, "I'll help Jay Leon, why don't you two go get some more supplies? Oh! And Leon, you might like this!" She threw something at the golden blonde who caught it quickly, "I found them earlier," her amber eyes twinkled cheerfully, "I didn't think you wanted Cynthia to find these,"
<br>
"Nope, thanks, Bree, come on Cynthia!" He pulled her to her feet and out of the room, pink staining his tanned cheeks.
