Bree, Jay, Leon - 20 ½

Cynthia- 21

Leon-20
<br></em>
:( :( :( :(
<br>
<br>"How in Starclan's sake am I going to get out of all of these infected!" Jay hissed as he fought his way through the hordes of infected that were trying to get to him.
<br>
"Duck!" He heard the familiar voice and obeyed, ducking as a brown haired, paralyzed girl in a modified wheelchair bounced off a roof and flew over his head to crash down on a bunch of infected, brutally smashing them.
<br>
"Hi, Jay!" She chirped cheerfully despite the horde they were surrounded by.
<br>
"Tell me you brought Cynthia and Leon as well."
<br>
"I did, here they come!" She grins and spins her chair, knocking a few more down before bouncing up and down as the sound of two silenced pistols being fired echoed nearby. Cynthia emerged, leaping off the roof Bree had been on and firing her silenced pistols as she fell, her handcrafted bow and quiver strapped to her back. "Hi!" Bree grinned throwing a thin throwing small throwing knives in an arch at a multitude of the infected, "I found him!"
<br>
"Awesome, Leon and I found a whole stash of ammo for our pistols, and more tools to add onto your wheelchair," Cynthia said briskly, switching from her pistols to her simple silver bladed knife, tendrils of her midnight black hair hanging down in front of her face near her nose.
<br>
Jay turned his attention to the black haired sharp shooter, cloudy blue eyes focusing on her. Years ago he had been attacked by an infected that managed to claw at his face and left vicious scars across his face along with a cloudy look and foggy blurry vision. "Where's Leon? You aren't carrying the backpack." Usually, Cynthia carried the backpack that they put found materials in due to her higher speed and agility compared to Leon.
<br>
"That's because Leon's being a pain in the butt because I've been sneezing all morning." She told him in exasperation with a small amount of annoyance in her tone, sapphire blue eyes flashing with partial amusement.
<br>
"Well you aren't infected if that's what he's worried about, you probably have a cold from jumping into the iced-over lake to fetch that supply drop yesterday." Jay told her, "Besides, I do have a few more vials of the immunity cure back at the safe house."
<br>
"Don't tell that to Leon," She mused wielding her blade like she was born to fight.
<br>

"Don't tell me what?" Leon asked as he dropped down to the ground from a roof and crushed a few infected as he landed, flicking crimson blood out of his golden blond hair and amber eyes, standing in a fighting stance, his brass knuckles on and streaked with dried and wet blood.
<br>
"That she's pregnant." Jay deadpanned and his brother nearly fell over in shock.
<br>
"What!" Leon yelled staring at his girlfriend who's face flushed bright scarlet, the color so bright it hid the freckles crossing the bridge of her lightly tanned nose and cheekbones.
<br>
"I am not!" She nearly shrieked, her voice high-pitched and strained, "Don't joke about that!" Her blue eyes were wide with shock and horror. To diminish her embarrassment she smacked Jay upside the head and went back to fighting the horde, her ears, visible from her black hair being up in a ponytail, bright scarlet as well, matching the color of her face.
<br>
"What's going on?" Bree asked, rolling back over to them all after having found an escape path during the conversation going on between the three of them.
<br>
"Nothing, just having a conversation involving the new supplies," Jay replied, picking up a chunk of concrete from the broken and dusty cobblestone street before hurling it at an infected; knocking the bloody-clothed infected humanoid creature to the ground with a lovely spot of crimson in place of its previously fat nose.
<br>
"A conversation that nearly gave me a heart attack!" Leon exclaimed, cracking an Infected creature's skull against a dirty brick wall, his ears were a light shade of embarrassed pink.
<br>
"If it gave you a heart attack then my heart stopped." Cynthia retorted in return. "That was a dirty trick Jay-" She cut herself off by sneezing violently.
<br>
"I found an escape path guys!" Bree grinned pointing to a small alleyway, "Let's go!" She shot off into the alley with Jay on her heels, Leon right behind him, Cynthia whipped out her bow, notched a whistling arrow and let it fly into the horde chasing after them, the sound from the arrow causing the humanoid creatures to stumble around and shriek in confusion.
<br>
Jay woke up in the middle of the night to violent coughing. Sitting up and blinking away a small amount of the blurriness of his vision he focused on Leon sitting next to Cynthia who was sitting up and was the source of the coughing, Leon was rubbing her back, blonde eyebrows pinching together in worry. Bree was sitting up as well, looking at the coughing teen with worry in her eyes. "How long has she been coughing?" Jay asked, getting to his feet and crouching next to the other three.
<br>
"She's been coughing on and off all night," Leon told him, "So about three or four hours."
<br>
"That's not good. Look at me Cynthia." Jay asked the coughing girl who gagged before the coughing ceased and she obeyed, lifting her head to look him in the eye, blue eyes groggy with traces of sleep, but had a slight glazed over look. He used the back of his hand to test for a fever and found a very small one. "No more jumping into freezing lakes alright?" He stood up, going over to his stuff and pulling out a medical kit and pulled out a dose from the latest batch of the homemade cold medication he had made a few days ago.
<br>
"What's wrong with her? Is she infected?!" Leon asked, his face pinching with worry.
<br>
"She's just got a small cold from jumping into the icy lake yesterday," Jay replied, crouching back in front of her with a water bottle and the small green pill. "Take this Cynthia, it'll taste disgusting but try and keep it down." Leon took the water bottle and opened it before handing it to the mentioned girl, who took it from him and took the medication, her expression immediately changing to disgust and she literally chugged the water to try and get rid of the taste.
<br>
"Give her some of the immunity Jay," Leon told his brother, "Please,"
<br>
"She already has a lot of it in her system, Leon," Jay cut off his brother as the golden blonde opened his mouth to cut him off. "But," He got to his feet and went over to the medical table where more of the immunity was being produced, "I'll give her a small dose if it'll help ease your mind." He measured out a very small dose of the immunity cure that seemed to cure pretty much everything, the clear pure liquid swirling around in the small clean shot glass and glowing light blue before it settled as he stopped pouring in anymore.
<br>
"Thank you." Leon murmured, hugging his girlfriend who was shivering slightly and had her blue eyes mostly closed.
<br>
"Here, you know the drill Leon, get her to drink it in small sips, I'm going back to bed," Jay muttered, handing his brother the tiny glass before going back to his sleeping area and getting back into the sleeping bag bed each of them had, and closing his eyes. Right away he was dragged into a memory.
<br>
<em>'Ah!" A thirteen-year-old Jay howled, struggling to get the weird humanoid creature off him, he could hear Leon howling in pain near him along with Holly screaming as well.
<br>
"Cynthia!" A higher pitched voice shrieked, "Look! Infected!"
<br>
"Well-" A girl's British sounding voice spoke and got interrupted by the first voice.
<br>
"Don't swear!"
<br>
"Why are you worried about my language at a time like this?!" The British sounding girl was speaking once again.
<br>
"We can't help them." Another female voice spoke, "We'd be killed in the process!"
<br>
"I'm going to act like I didn't hear you." The British voice spoke again and a gunshot rang out, Jay froze in shock and fear, feeling the creature above him go limp and still.
<br>
"Did you just shoot him?!"
<br>
"No you idiot!" the British voice retorted, and Jay felt someone haul the unmoving pile of humanoid creature off of him with a grunt, revealing a girl probably at the most a year older than he was with blood and grime streaking her clothes, a backpack strapped to her back with a small chainsaw strapped to the pack, "I shot the infected creature Haliah, I didn't shoot the boy." She rolled her sapphire blue eyes and went to go help Leon, taking out a rusty pipe from her bag and swinging it against the Infected human's skull, the force of her swing sending him to being fly into a wall where a loud crack was heard, splattering the nearby ground and walls with blood and gore. She dropped the now bloody pipe, before offering a hand to the golden blonde haired boy who took it and she helped him to his feet.
<br>
Once he was on his feet she went over to Holly and grabbed the Infected around the neck before sharply twisting, snapping its neck before pulling it off Holly and moving back to be standing with the other two girls. Jay glanced at Leon who was looking at the British-accented girl with what looked like shock and awe.
<br>
"Who are you?" Leon asked looking slightly dazed, his attention fixed on the blue eyed girl that had saved his life.
<br>
"Well I'm Haliah," A golden blonde girl with bright green eyes, average height, and a few years older than Jay and his siblings spoke "This is Hadara," She gestured to the light blonde with blue eyes who was a little on the tall side and was probably a year older than Haliah. "And this is-"
<br>
"I can introduce myself Haliah." The British-accented girl rolled her eyes before offering a handshake with Leon, "My name's Cynthia." She told them, smiling slightly at the golden blonde in front of her, she was of average height, four inches shorter than Leon, with midnight black hair and sapphire blue eyes.
<br>
Leon shook her hand gently, "My name's Leon, and these are my older siblings, Jay and Holly." He said, amber eyes locked on her blue ones.
<br>
"Leon, we need to get going," Holly fretted going over to her younger brother, "We're going to be killed if we stay here!"
<br>
Jay snorted with amusement as his brother didn't break eye contact with the strange girl as he answered his sister. "I know that Holly."
<br>
"We have a place you guys can stay with us, we came out here hearing screaming." The British-accented girl named Cynthia told the golden blonde in front of her, not breaking eye contact with him either.
<br>
Holly whispered to Jay, "Does Leon have a crush?" She asked with a small amount of amusement and worry. </em>
<br>
:) :) :)
<br>
"Leon, pass me that wrench," Jay told his brother from where they were working together on reinforcing Bree's chair, the girls were sharpening and checking over weapons near them.
<br>
"I don't see one Jay," Leon told him, scratching the back of his head a bit groggily. They had been awake for a few hours, but Leon had been up all night, keeping watch over his sick girlfriend and worried sick about her.
<br>
"Then open your eyes, Leon," Jay grumbled, still holding his hand out for the tool.
<br>
"I got it!" Bree reached over, grabbed the wrench and putting it into Jay's palm, smiling happily, as cheerful as she usually was in the mornings.
<br>
"At least someone's awake and listening." He grouched curtly, using the wrench to tighten the bolts on the new shock absorbers his brother and Cynthia had found
<br>
"Give him some slack Jay," Cynthia soothed the grumpy boy, with amusement in her voice, blue eyes twinkling cheerfully, "he's been up all night." Leon smiled slightly before yawning widely, displaying his tiredness as he paused checking over the spikes made from knife blades
<br>
"I'll cut him some slack when you two can stop preventing each other from getting any sleep in a scattered random pattern of nights." He grunted, tightening the last bolt while the two mentioned didn't even blush, instead, Cynthia continued her actions of cleaning her pistols and Leon argued with his brother.
<br>
"Maybe someone needs to stop being such a pain in the butt and see what's underneath your nose," Leon argued back, hinting at the idea of his brother finally getting together with their companion Bree.
<br>
"Good idea Leon, then maybe he'll stop being a such a big stick in the mud." Cynthia commented, supporting her golden blonde boyfriend and grinning at the black haired boy's maddened huff.
<br>
"I'm not a stick in the mud." He huffed, checking the straps on the wheelchair
<br>
"Jay," She deadpanned, "You are very much a grumpy stick in the mud."
<br>
"You guys! Stop berating him!" Bree interrupted, "He's not a stick in the mud, he's just different than all of us, each of us have a different attitude!" She chirps, supporting Jay and diffusing the argument, "I'll help Jay Leon, why don't you two go get some more supplies? Oh! And Leon, you might like this!" She threw something at the golden blonde who caught it quickly, "I found them earlier," her amber eyes twinkled cheerfully, "I didn't think you wanted Cynthia to find these,"
<br>
"Nope, thanks, Bree, come on Cynthia!" He pulled her to her feet and out of the room, pink staining his tanned cheeks.

      <summary>Guilt Ridden And Broken AU Part 1</summary>
        <p id= "Guilt"> <em>Cynthia, Leon- 16<br> <br>
Jay, Holly, Bree- 17<br> <br>
Haliah, Paige- 17 1/2 <br> <br>
Finli- 18 <br> <br> </em>
Cynthia's black hair whipped into her face as she spun on the spot to kick the closest object which happened to be a desk. <em>'I was there! I could've saved them! What was I thinking?!' </em>The fourteen-year old's heart sunk further to her stomach as she gazed outside of the room, blue eyes misty and distant. <em>'The woods, why did we have to go out there? Now all three of them are kidnapped!'</em><br> <br>
"Cindy," Haliah spoke meekly from where she was perched on her lower bunk, well away from her sister's self-anger. "There wasn't anything you could do, it wasn't your-"<br> <br>
"I could've done something!" Cynthia snarled, whirling around on her sister, blue eyes still misty and not from tears. "I could've prevented it from happening! I could've prevented them from being kidnapped!" She looked at her sister, angry and herself, weighed down with her guilt and looking tired and heartbroken, "My friend's were kidnapped Haliah! Right in front of me! And what did I do?! I did nothing! Nothing at all! They're gone Haliah!" She took a few short heaving breaths, "I could've done something! My friends are gone Haliah!" Her blue eyes brimmed with tears, "Gone." She dropped to her knees and stared blankly at the floor. "I'll never see them again."<br> <br>
Haliah hurried over and enveloped her younger sister in a hug as she burst into sobbing tears, the fifteen-year-old feeling miserable and worried about her sister, "Ssh, Cindy, it'll be okay," She lied, trying to comfort her sister.<br> <br>
"It'll never, be okay again!" Cynthia cried, burying her face in her sister's shirt, "My friends are gone!"<br> <br>
"Sshh," Haliah comforted hopelessly, knowing her sister wasn't going to be convinced everything was going to be okay with three of the four people she had known since they were all little kids, kidnapped.<br> <br>
:( :( :( :(<br> <br>
Cynthia watched the entrance to the woods from her position on the large boulder that gave a perfect viewpoint. Her blue eyes were currently shaded by white rimmed, black tinted lenses sunglasses, with the sun beating down on top of her the sunglasses allowed her to actually see what was going on. Her peaceful silence was broken by someone stirring up rocks of the gravel path toward her position accompanied by the sound of wheels rolling across the earth. Taking off the sunglasses and rubbing at her eyes slightly she let the duo approach, knowing exactly who it was. "Hey Bree, Haliah."<br> <br>
"Hi!"<br> <br>
"Hey Cindy, you okay? We brought you lunch-"<br> <br>
"Not hungry."<br> <br>
"-if you wanted it. You can save it and eat it later it won't spoil." Haliah finished quietly, putting down the lunch box and sitting next to her sister, green eyes worried about her.<br> <br>
"Is the mistiness clearing up?" Cynthia asked her with a sigh, looking up at her sister.<br> <br>
Like it had been since Jay Holly and Leon had been kidnapped two years ago, Cynthia's blue eyes were fogged over with a distant mistiness that Leah had pulled Haliah aside to tell her that the mistiness was caused by the constant and intense guilt Cynthia dealt with combined with the constant keeping guard over the woods to make sure nobody else gets lost or kidnapped as well. Basically her eyes with seriously tired, but the solution wasn't to sleep, the mistiness would only go away when and if Leon, Holly, and Jay returned.<br> <br>
"Yeah-"<br> <br>
"Don't lie Haliah." Cynthia said to her sister bluntly, "people still think I've gone crazy and am the crazy person who guards the forest. Why? Because of the stupid mistiness." She propped her head up on her palms, elbows on her knees.<br> <br>
"You aren't crazy Cynthia!" Bree looked at her friend, splitting a small sandwich and offering it to her, "but you are really stubborn!"<br> <br>
"Thanks for the compliment Bree," Cynthia laughed, rolling her eyes and accepting the sandwich half despite her earlier insistence on not being hungry.<br> <br>
"No problem!" Bree grinned, "You'd never guess what I saw today!" She exclaimed enthusiastically. So the three girls chatted with each other, Bree doing most of the chatting.<br> <br>
It was peaceful for a few minutes until Cynthia noticed something out of the corner of her eye and she sprang to her feet, "Someone's going into the woods." Springing off her boulder she sprinted towards the person going towards the dreary woods, "Hey! Stay out of there!" She shouted, Haliah and Bree on her heels.<br> <br>
The girl paused, looking over at Cynthia with curiosity. "Oh! You must be the girl who guards this place!"<br> <br>
Cynthia exchanged confused glances with her sister, <em>'What? Someone who doesn't know about the incident?'</em> "Yes, I am. Are you new here?"<br> <br>
"Yeah! My family's visiting the Bramble family!" The girl chirped and the three natives looked even more worried, the Bramble family was the family that Holly, Leon, and Jay belonged to, the only kids. "I could totally tell you're the one who guards here!"<br> <br>
"Let me guess, my eyes." Cynthia deadpanned, hiding her worry. "Why don't we take you back to the villa?" the villa was the fancy name for the neighborhood they lived in, an entire neighborhood centered around a giant tree that had been struck by lightning many years ago. Or at least that's what Packer and Mei, the community elders said.<br> <br>
"Okay! I was just curious about this place!"<br> <br>
:) :) :)<br> <br>
"My word," Cynthia sighed as she and Haliah entered their family's house, "That girl can talk! Even more than Bree, and that's saying something!"<br> <br>
"She's very…"<br> <br>
"Chatty? Annoying? Obnoxious?" Cynthia supplied as together they went up the stairs to their bedroom, their younger sibling's making a whole ton of noise from inside their room.<br> <br>
Haliah chose a nicer approach, "Energetic, like Bree." She decided, entering their room and wandering over to her twin sister Paige who was doing a craft of some sort. "Whatcha doing Paige?" She asked, looking over her twin's shoulder.<br> <br>
"Yikes!" Paige jumped and nearly smacked her sister in the face with her hot glue gun. Cynthia was less lucky and received a container of glitter to the face as she got closer to the desk.<br> <br>
Surprised and startled, Cynthia staggered backward and lost her balance. Crashing to the ground with a violent sneeze, the thing that had upset her balance. "Glitter is not something you want to inhale," She sneezed again before letting her head drop back to the floor, "Starclan above that burns!"<br> <br>
Haliah and Paige burst out laughing at the brief moment where their sister's normal personality shone through her depressed state. "You're not supposed to breathe it in Cindy!" Haliah giggled, grabbing a towel and disappearing to get it wet, the glitter Paige was using was dissolvable when in contact with skin and would dissolve under water.<br> <br>
"You're supposed to use it!" Paige laughed, putting out her glue gun to swivel around and face her younger sister, green eyes twinkling merrily.<br> <br>
Haliah came back with the soaking wet towel and dropped it on her sister's face with a splat. "Here you go!" She chirped cheerfully before laughing harder as her sister let out a shriek from the cold temperature of the water and scrambling up to her knees, taking the towel away from her face, revealing her face painted many different colors from the glitter.<br> <br>
"Gah!" Cynthia grumbled, now thoroughly waterlogged, her blue eyes gleamed as she came up with a plan for revenge, rubbing her face clean she then got to her feet and chased after her sisters, who both shrieked and sprinted away from her, running down the stairs and around the house, trying to avoid their sister who was chasing after them in an attempt to make their faces tie-dye from the dissolved glitter on the towel in her hands.<br> <br>
:) :) :)<br> <br>
"Dad!" Haliah ran behind her father, hiding behind him as Paige sprinted by, Cynthia laughing madly, right on her heels. "Cindy's going to paint us tie-dye!"<br> <br>
"Help me! Haliah!" Paige pleaded as she ran back through the room, Cynthia close enough to her that the latter could throw the towel and hit the back of her head, "She's going to get me!"<br> <br>
"Gotcha!" Cynthia tackled her sister and pressed the wet towel to her face, cackling, "Revenge!" she grinned and burst into laughter along with Haliah at both the stunned expression on Paige's face, and the tie-dye all over her face, she looked like someone had exploded a bunch of pink, purple, blue, and red paint balloon on her face.<br> <br>
"You three!" Sarah came into the room from the kitchen, "I hope you three remember that we are going to the Bramble's house in an hour!" She was frazzled, with three teenagers, two eight-year-olds, and a preteen she had a lot to deal with. The moment she said that she covered her mouth, amber eyes widening just slightly. Talking about the Brambles had an unspoken rule of it not happening while Cynthia was home, even just mentioning them was enough for the teenager to stop short of whatever she was doing and go hide somewhere in the house, somewhere quiet enough she could go cry or sneak off to the boulder to take her post by the woods.<br> <br>
Haliah and Paige's smiles fell as they looked at their younger sister who's expression dropped to be depressed and miserable once again. <em>'Uh oh.'</em> Haliah thought, <em>'there goes the cheer.' </em>"Cindy…" she said, trying to find something to say to cheer her up again.<br> <br>
"It's fine. Let's go see my missing friends' parents, they're probably really lonely." Cynthia said, her voice miserable, blue eyes haunted, "I'll go wash the glitter out of this towel." She darted off up the stairs and out of sight.<br> <br>
"I'm sorry," Sarah said in a partial whisper,<br> <br>
"It's okay, Mom," Paige smiled weakly at her mother, "You didn't mean too, Cindy knows that."<br> <br>
<em>'I haven't seen that mischievous side for a while,'</em> Haliah reflected, her gaze resting on the empty stairwell, <em>'We need to find them, it's not fair that Cindy has to deal with her friend's missing and kidnapped, especially when she's been in love with one of them for years.'</em> She took a deep breath, "I'll go find her, you get everything prepared Paige," She told her twin and jogged up the stairs, looking for her younger sister, she found her up in the attic, sitting quietly in front of the small circular window. <em>'She's really upset if she's up here.' </em>The large attic had originally Cynthia's room which had somehow morphed into a place where all three of the Bramble kids came over and the six of them with the edition of Bree and Finli hung out, playing random games, having sleepovers, all the normal kid stuff. But after the woods incident Cynthia had stepped into the room only a handful of times, and never to sit by herself, usually to grab something of hers that she really needed and nobody else had.<br> <br>
"Leon liked it here," Cynthia spoke, apparently noticing her older sister's presence.<br> <br>
<em>'Oh, Cindy…' </em>Haliah thought, her heart heavy as she walked over to the window seat and took a seat next to her sister, looking at her and studying her face, noticing the distance in her eyes and the way she was holding herself, tired, worn out, dejected. She let her talk, it was unusual for Cynthia to say anything about her friends when she did, it was never Leon, keeping her feelings about that particular person under lock and key.<br> <br>
"He liked looking through the window and watching the sun rise or fall over the woods. He never admitted it, though, saying watching the sun was a girl thing when the others were around. But he didn't say anything like that when it was just the two of us. He often said he liked being high up, able to see everything from here to the lake past the woods and even the edge of River pond sometimes. Not that you can see it from here." Cynthia said quietly, gazing unseeingly out of the window. "I wonder sometimes…" She trailed off, blinking so her blue eyes focused on the window and the outside world.<br> <br>
"I'm sure he thinks about you too," Haliah softly told her sister, "You're just as important as his siblings are to him, Cindy."<br> <br>
:( :( :(<br> <br>
(Cynthia's View)<br> <br>
I knew I was important to him, it's always been that way, even when we were innocent little kids playing in our backyards or up here. But there was always the heart-wrenching feeling that he wasn't coming back and I couldn't do a single thing about it. Two years. Two long years since I've heard Leon whispering in my ear, two years since I've had Holly tutoring me in science and literature, two years since I had Jay give me advice on the many injuries I sustained on a weekly basis.<br> <br>
It hurt being alone like this, my sister's are amazing, and they try their hardest to make me happy, but there wasn't anything they could do or say to replace my friends. They can't be Leon, who would wrap his arms around me and whisper how much I meant to him in my ear as we sat here quietly watching whatever was going on outside; they can't be Holly, who would freak out at the idea of missing two years of school work, staining her perfect academic record; they can't be Jay who would roll his eyes at Bree's happy chatter and comment that she speaks faster than a cheetah runs.<br> <br>
Bree's the only one who knows where I'm coming from. She was there too, a tree fell on top of her while we were in the forest running after the man who had kidnapped our friends. She was paralyzed and broken physically while I was ruined emotionally, and I'm sure she is too, she's just a better person, able to help others and keep cheerful while hurting on the inside. But I know for a fact that she was used to not having Jay show a whole lot of affection for her, I'm not used to that, I probably never will be. I'm used to having Leon wearing his heart on his sleeve, everyone knew we liked each other more than friends, but nobody knew the whole extent. Leon and I had many stolen moments, of which makes it painful to remember at the moment. I closed my eyes, tired of looking out the window and instead held the first two fingers of my right hand against my lips, ignoring Haliah for the moment. The worst part about their disappearance was the fact that I had literally kissed Leon for the first time barely ten minutes before they were kidnapped. I ended up frightening Leon and he ran off into the woods, Holly and Jay chased after him and Bree and I chased after them.<br> <br>
"This entire thing is my fault." I sighed, letting my arm drop, my knuckles briefly rapping against the window in front of me as I did so and opened my eyes again. "The day they disappeared I ended up frightening Leon and he ran off into the woods, his siblings ran after him and Bree and I followed a few moments later." It was strange, Leon had kissed me many times before that moment, either on the cheek, forehead, nose, or an actual kiss, but the moment I tried taking some initiative he got scared. I rested my head on my knees, feeling more drained than I usually did.<br> <br>
"If I hadn't frightened him he wouldn't have run into the woods."<em> 'And I wouldn't be alone, feeling like part of myself has gone missing with each of them.'</em> <br> <br>
"That doesn't seem like Leon Cindy," Haliah told me softly, "He wouldn't run from you, no matter what you did."<br> <br>
"Maybe so, but this theory points the blame at me, so I'll take it," I replied quietly.<em> 'I'd rather feel like this is my fault than some random person.' </em> reluctantly I gazed out the slightly dusty window once again, looking at the smaller house across the street. "We should get going before mom kills us both," I said with a small amount of forced humor, tearing my eyes away from the other house and getting to my feet, staring down at the floor as I walked down the stairs to the room I shared with my older sisters. <em> 'Where ever you are Leon, Holly, Jay, I hope you're all safe. I love you, Leon.'</em><br> <br>
:( :( :( :( :(<br> <br>
Leon's breathing grew heavy as he twitched, dreaming, his amber eyes tightly closed. Holly and Jay were asleep as well, trying to get some decent sleep through the chilly no heating or cooling cabin. Leon twitched, turning his head slightly, and rolling onto his side, obviously uncomfortable, something in the dream disturbing him.<br> <br>
<em>"Cindy! Help!" Leon struggled against his captor, struggling to get free.<br> <br>
"Fang! Get the girl!" his captor snarled and a large white wolf dog burst from the undergrowth to tackle Cynthia, knocking her to the ground and dragging her away by the ankle, snarling, it's strong jaws locked around her ankle. Cynthia shrieked, trying to grab onto the grass or anything that could stop her from being dragged away, struggling to reach her friends.<br> <br>
"Leon! No!"<br> <br>
Leon had to watch as she was dragged out of the small clearing into the undergrowth, disappearing from view, a moment later a high pitched, frightened, and pain filled scream rang through the woods.</em><br> <br>
"No! Cindy!" He yelled, jerking awake in the process, jolting upright, forehead clammy with cold sweat as he breathed heavily, his siblings jerking awake as well. "It was a dream, just a dream." He tried to reassure himself as the dream played out in his mind once again.<br> <br>
"Are you okay Leon?" Holly asked, rubbing her green eyes and looking at her younger brother, "Did something scare you?"<br> <br>
"N-no, but my imagination running wild," Leon replied, stuttering a little at the beginning, his amber eyes wide and scared. <em> 'Cyn's not here, she's fine, we're all okay.' </em>
"Are you sure? You look really pale."<br> <br>
"I'm fine, Holly, just gotta catch my breath," Leon replied, laying back down on his side away from her to hide the fear in his eyes. <em> 'But that wasn't a dream, that was a memory… I have to check on her.'</em>  He waited until his sister was asleep before slipping out the window and heaving himself up into a tree before running precariously along the branches and stopping once he reached the edge of the woods. <em> 'Is she here? Starclan let her be here!'</em> He looked around and soon enough he caught sight of a figure sitting quietly on a large boulder, looking at the woods with a longing expression on her face, like she longed to go out there and search for something. <em> 'Thank you Starclan!' </em> He drank in the sight of his best friend, the one he loved. Sitting with her knees drawn up to her chest Cynthia was sitting quietly, currently bathed in moonlight, the only person awake at the late hours of the night besides Leon himself. <em> 'She's perfectly fine, she's safe. I've got to do something to tell her I'm alive.'</em> He looked around and searched his pockets, finding a small pen and a piece of paper he wrote four simple words on the paper. Before turning the paper into a paper airplane and throwing it so it landed in her lap. <em> 'Please understand, please!' </em><br> <br>
He knew it had worked when Cynthia's gaze shot up to be staring in his general direction and he saw another airplane fly past him. With no knowledge of where he was, she did a pretty good job. Unfolding the airplane he read what she had written underneath his words. With a small smile, he replied, deciding to use the nickname he only used when he was being fully sincere. He got a reply a moment later and cracked a grin at her response before scribbling down a reply and throwing it once again, watching her intently for her reaction. She snorted and rolled her eyes before scribbling down a reply and hurtling it back in his direction. Leon pulled his open and his amber eyes softened, writing down a reply before he glanced back at the cabin to check if Ashton was back, cause if he was he had to hurry back. The paper airplane hit him in the face this time and he opened it, looking at the reply sadly before replying and waiting impatiently for her response as one of the lights in the cabin turned on. A moment later he got a reply. He glanced down at it, smiled wistfully before starting to run back the way he came. <em> 'I love you too, Cyn, more than you'd believe.' </em> He thought as he snuck back into the cabin and laid back down, pretending to sleep as Ashton stomped around.<br> <br>
Meanwhile, a small piece of paper fluttered to the ground from the trees, revealing the conversation between the two lonely teens crammed onto the small paper.<br> <br>
<em> I love you, Cyn. <br>
I love you too, Leo, I know you're out there somewhere.<br>
I'm close enough I can see you, and you're beautiful, My Sunshine.<br>
While I can not say the same because I can't see you and you aren't a girl, I can say that I'm sure you're as handsome as you always are and have been.<br>
How can you attack and boost my ego at the same time? <br>
It's a skill I've gained over the years… I miss you, Leo. <br>
I miss you too, Cyn, I wish I could reveal myself to you and go hug you. <br>
But you can't, you're being held, prisoner. <br>
I have to leave, Cyn, don't miss me too much okay? <br>
I can never miss you too much, Sabersword, I can't really do this in person, so instead I'll do it the old fashioned way. Xoxo<br>
I love you with all my heart, Leo.</em> </p>

  <summary>Bree's Accident</summary>
  <p id= "Bree"> <em> Bree and Ben are 13<br> <br>

Brittany is 14</em> <br> <br>

"I can't wait!" Bree squealed jumping up and down while shaking her brother by the shoulders, "The school trips tomorrow!"<br> <br>

Ben laughed, gently peeling her fingers from his shoulders, "I can't wait for it either, but I don't think shaking my brains out will help anyone. Why don't we use that excess energy of yours in a game of soccer? We can even get dad and Brittany to play."<br> <br>

"Okay!" She grinned widely, running into the room she shared with Brittany and hauling her sister along with her down the stairs, her neon blue soccer ball tucked under one arm. Ben chuckled watching his sisters tromp outside into the backyard before going down to find his father Gunner, who was sitting in his favorite armchair sipping his coffee pretending to read the newspaper while actually watching cat and cucumber videos, mildly chuckling in between sips.<br> <br>

"Come on dad! We're playing soccer!" Ben said, impatiently waiting for his father. Gunner folded his newspaper and put both that and his coffee down on the coffee table before following his son outside just in time to see Bree tumble off the fence she'd been running on top of. She rolled to a stop at her father's feet before bouncing back up like a spring.<br> <br>

"Hi, daddy!" The hyperactive teen bounced on the balls of her feet, an infectious grin on her face. "Let's play!" She swiped her ball back from her sister who was using it like a hackeysack before tearing down their small yard towards one of the soccer goals, causing Ben to chase after her and Brittany to yell, "Boy's vs girls!" Before sprinting after her siblings, Gunner on her heels.<br> <br>

"How are you still not tired Bree!" Ben gasped, he was lying on the grass trying to catch his breath under the shade of their oak tree. Bree was stalking a small blue jay on her hands and knees, she didn't answer his question too engrossed with her stalking of the bird.<br> <br>

"She's too bouncy for her own good." Brittany snorted, taking out an earphone and joining in on the conversation, "We all know that by now." She was leaning against the tree's trunk listening to music from her iPhone.<br> <br>

Gunner laughed wheezily, still working on being able to breathe after the exhorting game against his three kids, "She's just happy you two, she's always happy." A startled squawk signaled Bree's success on sneaking up on the bird. Now she was sitting Indian style in the grass gently petting the startled animal, chattering cheerfully at the blue jay and stroking it's ruffled feathers soothing and calming it. Gunner smiled, "I'm proud of her." He looks at the other two kids, "I proud of all of you."<br> <br>

:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)<br> <br>

"Ben! Get up!" Bree yelled cheerfully banging open her twin brother's door, "Get up! It's time to go to the trip! Brittany is already awake and ready!" She pulled her brother's blankets off his bed and bounced back out the door, going to feed her blue jay Jackson. That same bird she crept up on yesterday and named after a boy in her class. Ben groaned rolling out of his bed and hitting the floor with a loud thump, causing his sisters to burst into laughter in their room.<br> <br>

Ben groggily rubbed his eyes, he was sitting on the bus with his best friends Mike, Brendan, and Fin with his sister Bree and her "acquaintance" Jay Bramble in the seat in front of him. "Man!" Mike grinned, "I can't wait till we get there!" Ben's eyes drifted closed and he was out for the rest of the bus ride.<br> <br>

:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) : ):) :) :) :) :) :) :)<br> <br>

Bree was in Liam's group, eagerly waiting for the older man to lead his group of kids into the gorge for the rock climbing part of the overnight camping trip. Bree was itching to explore but she stayed where she was with her group leader Thornclaw keeping a firm hold on her shoulder to remind her not to run off. Bouncing along next to Theo and Liam she entertained them both with different stories she knew by heart, eventually convincing the entire group to sing "Flashlight" with her, overall she kept the entire group cheerful tripping on rocks and slipping in puddles with a dramatic flare to make everyone laugh.<br> <br>

Brittany was the only one not reacting to her sister, instead looking at her younger sister through jealous filled narrowed eyes as Bree tripped and nearly knocked her section leader to the floor, giggling as she sprung back up and started walking backwards pulling funny faces and imitating voices making the quickly tiring students laugh and chat with one another. Brittany had always been jealous of the quality that she herself lacked, the ability to cheer anyone up and make them all happy. She resented it even more now that her mother paid more attention to Bree as she could cheer her up and chat for hours about the craziest things imaginable.<br> <br>

Finally, they arrived at the campsite and everyone started climbing up the rock face. With help of course. Liam and Theo had issues keeping Bree still long enough to help put the climbing harness on her before she jumped into the challenge. Bre startled the guy who was anchoring her by climbing by a monkey and was hauling herself up to the top within a few minutes, dangling her legs and laughing before helping haul the others to get all the way up so they could get the promised cold Gatorade and ice cream after when they had dinner back at the camp.<br> <br>

When Bree reached to help Brittany the mentioned person slapped her hands away and struggled to get up all the way before Bree stubbornly seized her sister by the wrists and helped her up. Once she was up Bree whooped dancing around on the cliff grinning widely and playfully singing "We are the champion" at the top of her lungs. Everyone was laughing as she finished the off-key singing and they all started climbing down, everyone mingling and joking around with each other. Bree bounced around while they waited, starting a game of tag to entertain herself and others. With everyone tired out <em> <strong>(except the drunk on happiness Breeanna)</em> </strong> Liam and Theo led the way back to camp, Liam far ahead humming under his breath, a spring in his usually dreary step as Bree walked alongside him rambling about her blue jay at home.<br> <br>

Bree jolted awake when she heard Diana scream, "Move! The tree's falling!" Scrambling to her feet and ushering the others away from the campsite, one of the girls, Mei was whining about her phone in her bag.<br> <br>

"I'll grab it," Liam said gruffly, going back to the tree.<br> <br>

Bree jerked out of Theo's grip and sprinted after him, "Liam no!" The tree crashed down with a crunch and it was silent<br> <br>

:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)<br> <br>

(Bree's View) <br> <br>

Pain seared across my back, startling me from my half-conscious state. <em>'Liam!'</em> I forced my eyes open, my vision tinged red from the pressure on my back. I looked over at Liam to find him less than inches from the collapsed tree, also unconscious, a branch was lying broken over his head. But he was breathing at least. I let my eyes slide close with the comfort that my effort wasn't for nothing. The tree on top of my body creaked and I heard a sickening crack before I suddenly lost all feeling in the part of my body pinned under the tree. The pain mostly disappeared but by then my senses were already overloaded and my usually bright and happy world faded into darkness and silence.<br> <br>

:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)<br> <br>

Theo rushed towards the tree as he threw his phone to one of the shocked students, "Someone call Firen and Gunner, tell them to get a four wheeler down here right away, tell them to bring Leah with them, someone's badly hurt." One of the girls obeyed calling the asked people while Theo and the boys attempted to lift the tree up off Bree and Liam. Brittany sprinted over, grasping her sister's wrists and trying to pull her out. By the time the sound of a four-wheeler became loud as it got close, the tree was already starting to splinter. Gunner jumped from the four wheelers and sprinted over, straining to lift the tree off his daughter. Firen joined in along with another student they brought, standing at 6 feet with golden hair and amber eyes. <br> <br>

After a lot of struggling Bree was pulled out from under the tree, her shirt speckled with crimson from the bark rubbing against her skin Leah delivered news nobody wanted to hear, "Her spine's broken, I can't fix this on my own. Firen, can you get Sophie to have an operations room ready? We can't fix the break but we can stop the internal bleeding. "Let's go! Hurry! Jay, she's going on your lap and you need to constantly test for a pulse." The blind black and gray speckled haired boy grumbled but let Leah set Bree down so she was laying across all of their laps, head lolling to one side her body limp like a ragdoll. Firen started the four-wheeler and with the squealing of tires the eight (Jay, the golden blonde, Leah, Firen, Gunner, Bree, Brittany, and Liam) people in the cart disappeared in a cloud of dust.<br> <br>

:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)<br> <br>

(Jay's 3rd person view)<br> <br>

Why Jay himself got stuck on babysitting duty he has no idea, but strangely he doesn't particularly mind. After all, Bree wasn't awake and the only sounds were gentle breathing and the beeping of medical machines. Of course, his silence was ruined when she woke with a groan. "Hello, Breanna." He said curtly, closing his braille book calmly and turning his head in her general direction.<br> <br>

"How many time do I have to tell you Furball that my name's Bree?" Bree smiled, making sure humor was present in her voice. "You got stuck as my babysitter?"<br> <br>

"Yup, do you feel anything past your waist?"<br> <br>

"Actually no, nothing past my waist... Wait, Jay doesn't tell me!" <br> <br>

"Yes Bree, your worst fear came true I'm afraid." Jay sighed, looking her directly in the eyes, cloudy blue eyes staring directly at her face. "You're paralyzed from the waist down Bree... I'm sorry I couldn't do anything about it."<br> <br>

Bree's face fell and tears brimmed at her eyes as her head drooped so her chin was resting on her chest. Jay stood up and clumsily patted her head in comfort. "You're family's outside Bree, would you like me to let them in?- Woah!" He was startled to feel Bree lunge at him and wrap her arms around his back sobbing into his t-shirt. Jay stood there a bit awkwardly before hesitantly patting her on the back, his stance stiff and uncomfortable. Reluctantly he let her cry, grumbling, "So now I'm a giant tissue." Bree laughed through her tears at his sarcastic reply. Just for good measure she rubbed her nose against his stomach before letting go and stretching up to flick him in the nose with a laugh as he violently sneezed.<br> <br>

"Let them in you grumpy bear." Bree smiled ushering him away. Jay grabbed his book and left with no complaints before letting her family in and fuss over her, assuring them she'll live and wouldn't stop breathing during the night. Bree smiled at her family, the uncomfortable feeling of being paralyzed wasn't welcome, but her friendship with Jay and seeing her family care was definitely welcomed. <br> <br> </p>
