<P> Let's start with what we know. This is the monster from the first season, nicknamed the demagorgon.<br>
  <img title="The monster from stranger things, similar to the piranha plant from Mario." src="http://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2016/08/02045011/stranger-things-700x525.jpg"/><br>
  <p align="center"> There is strong evidence that the demagorgon originates from an alternate universe/timeline, and is attracted to their world through blood. Although, it is unknown as to why the demagorgon transports complex organisms to its universe, (the upside down).
