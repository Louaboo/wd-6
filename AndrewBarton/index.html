    <h1>Elite Dangerous</h1>
    <p>  Elite Dangerous is a space game.
      You start with a small ship, called a Sidewinder.<br>
      You try and make money any of the three ways possible.
      The ways to make money are trading, combat, or exploring.
      Trading is the most profitable, yet you have to have the right ship to be able to make any good amount of money.
      Combat is the next best, yet you also have to have the right ship.
      Exploring is the lest benificial. Also, along with trading and combat, you have to have the correct ship.
    </p>
    <h3>Trading</h3>
    <p> Trading is like it sounds.
      You take a cheep resource from one station and transport it to a different one that will buy it for more than you paid.
      After, you can then take a resource cheep there and take it back to the first station which will buy it for more.
      This process is very boring and takes a long time, yet it is the best way to make money.
      It is also the lest exciting, nothing happens a lot, other than occasionally you get attacked and either you have to escape or fight.
