    <h1>Elite Dangerous</h1>
    <p>  Elite Dangerous is a space game.
      You start with a small ship, called a Sidewinder.
      You try and make money any of the three ways possible.
      The ways to make money are trading, combat, or exploring.
      Trading is the most profitable, yet you have to have the right ship to be able to make any good amount of money.
      Combat is the next best, yet you also have to have the right ship.
      Exploring is the lest benificial. Also, along with trading and combat, you have to have the correct ship.
    </p>
    <h3>Trading</h3>
    <p> Trading is like it sounds.
      You take a cheep resource from one station and transport it to a different one that will buy it for more than you paid.
      After, you can then take a resource cheep there and take it back to the first station which will buy it for more.
      This process is very boring and takes a long time, yet it is the best way to make money.
      It is also the least exciting, nothing happens a lot, other than occasionally you get attacked and either you have to escape or fight.
    </p>
    <h3>Combat</h3>
    <p> Combat is fighting other ships, wither they be AI or Human.
      There are many ways that one can go about doing this.
      One is to go to RES site, a Resource Extraction Site, and farm AI that have bounty on them.
      These AI are trying to take resource's from other AI or a human.
      If you are allied to a faction, which system you are in, there will be enforces that will start destroying ships with bounty on them.
    </p>
    <p> Another way to do combat is to interdict ships that are in supercruise, which is the way ships travel in systems.
      To interdict you must have a Frame Shift Drive Interdictor, which will allow you to take someone out of supercruise, the mod of travel you use to travel in a solar system.
      You must be behind the target and have you Interdictor active.
      Once you have the tether attached, you have to stay in line with the enemy to perform the interdict.
      You and your target will leave Supercruise and you can then proceed to destory them.
    </p>
