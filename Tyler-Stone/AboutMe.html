<font size="9">Yo, wassup T Gang, it's yo boy, T-Diggy... Real talk, i've been through a lot in my life.. I've fought through abusive parents, and I can't describe how much more I have been through. But I fought through it, and I got out... Thorugh my times, I would write songs about the things i'd be going through, and rapping came natural. I then turned 18, and it was time for me to get out of this terrible home. I left, never looking back, and it was the best day of my life. Anywhere was better than there. I then signed up for a tournament, and came in first, that's where my life started. I got $420,000 to spend anywhere. I bought a nice house and I had people calling me everyday, including my parents, (I never answered their calls.) Yet, I got a call from MGM Records, and got signed as a rapper. And from there... Here we are!</font>
