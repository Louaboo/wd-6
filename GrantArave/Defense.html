      <p class="words"><font size="3">Bastion is an attack robot that is fascinated by nature.
      Bastion has 200 health and 100 armor and has three abilities: ironclad, reconfigure, and self-repair. Bastion's reconfiguration
      ability lets him go into sentry mode and back into his recon mode. It takes 1 second to configure
      into sentry mode and takes 0.5 seconds to configure into the recon mode. Bastion's ironclad ability
      lets him take 20% less damage while in the sentry configuration. His last known ability is his self-repair,
      which heals 75hp per second and has a duration of 4 seconds as long as you hold down the button. It takes
      1 seconds to cooldown or when the self-repair is used all the way it takes 7 seconds to cooldown. . Bastion's ultimate ability is called Tank configuration.
      Even though this is a configuration he does not take 20% less damage but gives him more health and each shot
      does 205 damage with a direct hit and can do 35 damage to himself. Bastions recon blaster does 6-20 damage and has 25 bullets. His sentry configuration has 300 bullets and does 4-15
      damage, but he cannot get headshots while in his sentry mode.</p>

      Molten Core and this gives him his level 3 turret, but it also gives him 300 more health from armor and gives him 50% more
