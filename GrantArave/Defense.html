    <h2 align="left">Bastion<h2>
      <p class="words"><font size="3">Bastion is an attack robot that is fascinated by nature.
      Bastion has three abilities: ironclad, reconfigure, and self-repair. Bastion's reconfiguration
      ability lets him go into sentry mode and back into his recon mode. It takes 1 second to configure
      into sentry mode and takes 0.5 seconds to configure into the recon mode. Bastion's ironclad ability
      lets him take 20% less damage while in the sentry configuration. His last known ability is his self-repair,
      which heals 75hp per second and has a duration of 4 seconds as long as you hold down the button. It takes
      1 seconds to cooldown or when the self-repair is used all the way it takes 7 seconds to cooldown. . Bastion's ultimate ability is called Tank configuration.
      Even though this is a configuration he does not take 20% less damage but gives him more health and each shot
      does 205 damage with a direct hit and can do 35 damage to himself. Bastions recon blaster does 6-20 damage and has 25 bullets. His sentry configuration has 300 bullets and does 4-15
      damage, but he cannot get headshots while in his sentry mode.</p>

      <p class="words"><font size="3"> Hanzo brother of Genji and which he has killed. Hanzo wields a bow
      and has 3 abilites: scatter arrows, sonar arrow, and wall climb. Hanzo's scatter arrows do 22 per arrow
      uncharged and 75 damage per arrow while fully charged. There are 6 arrows that come out and cannot headshot
      with the arrows that come out. This ability has a 10 seconds cooldown and the scatter arrows come from the
      initial arrow then split which can bounce off walls. Hanzo's sonar arrow lets teamates and you see enemies
      in a 10 meter radius and does 125 damage fully charged and 29 damage uncharge, but has a 20 second cooldown.
      Hanzo's wall climb ability, the same as Genji's, lets him get to higher places. Hanzo's ultimate ability is
      called DragonStike and does 125 damage with the arrow and does 200 damage per second with anyone standing
      in the dragons.</p>
