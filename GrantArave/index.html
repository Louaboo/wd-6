    <h1 align="center">Welcome To Overwatch<h1>
      <p class="words"><font size="3">This game is a fps and has different classes that you can play as.
        There are four categories: Offense, Defense, Tank, and Support. These
        categories have different characters that you can play as. All characters
        have different abilities and have different advantages and disadvantages
        to bring to the team. There are four different categories to play the game. Quickplay,
        Competitive, Arcade, and Play against AI.</p>
    <h2 align="left">Quickplay<h2>
      <p class="words"><font size="3"> Quickplay is like competitive, although you are not winning for SR or
        playing to get competitive points. Instead you are playing to prep for competitve. The only thing that
        Quickplay and competitive have in common is that you cannot stack heros. Although in Quickplay, unlike
        competitive, the only way to win in payload is to cap all of the points. In compeitive you have to get
        push the payload farther than the enemy team. Also, like competitive, the way to win in King of the Hill
        is to have the cap until the end of the game where it says how many rounds you have won.  </p>
    <h2 align="left">Competitive<h2>
      <p class="words"><font size="3">Competitive is a gamemode where people
        are playing for competitive points and SR. This gamemode gives poeple
        rank which puts you with other people around your rank. This rank also gives
        you, at the end of the season, competitive points which gets you a golden gun. You
        get 10 competitive points every game you win. You need 3000 competitive points form
        a golden gun. Also with every game you play and win you get competitive points and you get SR.
        SR are points that increase or decrease, depending on win or lose, your rank. Now
        because of the rank system there are 8 different categories for rank. These categories
        give you different a amount of competitive points at the end of the season shown by
        the table below.</p>
