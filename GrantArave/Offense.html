    <h2 align="left">Genji<h2>
      <p class="example"><font size="3"> Genji has the most maneuverability out of all
        of the hero's in overwatch. Genji's abilities consist of his dash and his deflect.
        The dash's cooldown is 8 seconds and Genji's deflect lasts 2 seconds and it takes 8
        seconds to recharge. His dash can go through enemies doing damage and once Genji kills someone his dash,
        if not charged, is restored. Genji's reflect can deflect most ultimates and abilities.
        He can also deflect any projectile so lasers are his weak point. What makes Genji so
        maneuverable is his double jump and his ability to climb up walls. Genji's ultimate is
        his katana or dragonblade which he pulls out and does 120 damage per hit. Once he is
        in his ultimate he recharges his dash ability. Genji's primary weapon is his shurikens.
        These shurikens have two ways to throw them. You can throw them in a straight line or
        in a fan. Genji only throws three shurikens at a time with the ammo being 24.<p>
